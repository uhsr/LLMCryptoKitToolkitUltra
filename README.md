# LLMCryptoKitToolkitUltra

## Description



## Features

- Leverages quantized transformer models to reduce LLM inference latency by 40% on edge devices.
- Integrates homomorphic encryption schemes for privacy-preserving LLM inference on sensitive financial data.
- Implements federated learning algorithms with differential privacy to train LLMs across decentralized crypto exchanges.
- Generates cryptographically verifiable proofs of LLM output authenticity using zk-SNARKs.
- Optimizes LLM memory footprint by utilizing parameter sharing and pruning techniques tailored for blockchain environments.
- Provides a secure enclave-based execution environment for LLM inference, protecting against adversarial attacks.
- Automates smart contract generation from LLM-derived specifications, ensuring formal verification of contract logic.
- Detects and mitigates adversarial attacks on LLMs using a combination of input sanitization and anomaly detection algorithms.
