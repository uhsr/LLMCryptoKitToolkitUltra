# LLMCryptoKitToolkitUltra

## Description

A Rust-based cryptocurrency library implementing zero-knowledge proofs for transaction privacy using the Bulletproofs protocol, optimized for embedded systems with a custom elliptic curve arithmetic backend.

## Features

- Integrates with Hugging Face Transformers to load and fine-tune pre-trained language models.
- Encrypts sensitive data using AES-256 encryption with key derivation based on PBKDF2.
- Generates cryptographic keys using hardware security modules (HSMs) via PKCS#11 interface.
- Implements federated learning algorithms to train LLMs on decentralized datasets without data sharing.
- Verifies the integrity of downloaded LLM weights using SHA-384 checksums and digital signatures.
- Provides differential privacy mechanisms, such as adding Gaussian noise, to protect training data.
- Supports quantization and pruning techniques to reduce LLM size and improve inference speed on edge devices.
- Enables secure multi-party computation (MPC) for collaborative LLM training with confidential data.
## Installation
